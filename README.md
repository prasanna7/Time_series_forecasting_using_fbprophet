# Time_series_forecasting_using_fbprophet
This repository is a simple demonstration of using Prophet to solve forecasting of time series data. Prophet is an open source algorithm to forecast values. The dataset used is a retail store sales data for each month. Using the easy implementation of the algorithm, we are able to forecast the values for test period and explain the model's performance.
